## Tips
### ProTip I
1. stop using images, gifs, and hard-coded colors (standard colors) 
2. use vectors instead
3. if you're into web applications, research SVGs and FontAwesome and Glyphicons
4. Its all about User Experience
5. Alot of thesis-built systems have bottlenecks not on the system itself pero sa UI

### ProTip II

Its easy to program, but understanding the logic, guidelines, conventions, workflow and proper object oriented approach is hard.

its not about the program or the codebase itself, its about the artistic, creative and simplistic approach that the users see, and the sophisticated and well packaged codebase that the developers see.

Always remember:

1. you're not the only user
2. you will not be the only developer
